# **Handle With Care: This Code is Fresh 🧼**

Backend? Clean and minimal. The frontend? Let’s just say it has a bit more going on.

## 🚀 **What to Do?**

1. **Step into the `library-manager/` folder**. That’s where your answers are.
2. Run the ritual:
   ```bash
   yarn
   yarn start
   ```
3. **Explore** the app. Things get interesting fast.

## 🎨 **How’s the UI?**

_How's the UI?_ you ask. Well... let’s just say, _"Not great, not terrible."_ But don’t worry, you’re here for the code, not the design. Right? 😏

## 🧩 **The Rest?**

There’s another README hiding in the `frontend` folder. It holds the key to everything.
